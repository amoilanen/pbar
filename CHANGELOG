- Removed the unnecessary 'test' task from Rakefile as echoe already includes it
- Removing tabulation from the source files
- Submitting the Eclipse project settings (Eclipse DLTK is used for development)
- Renaming the classes and the module to reflect their purposes in a clearer way
- Splitting the class Progress so that it has a single responsibility: computing the current status
- Support for adding multiple listeners to Progress

TODO:
- Making the classes use some Ruby specific features in order for them to look less Java-like
- Write tests for ConsoleReporter
- Make ConsoleReporter report on Windows
